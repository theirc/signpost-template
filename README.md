# Signpost Template

This repository is the website template for creating new Signpost instances.

This README pertains to working with this repository as a template for new
instances. There's also `README-SITE.md` that describes how to operate a site
created from this template.

## Instructions for setting up a new Signpost instance

### 1. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### 2. Swap README

1. Delete this README and rename `README-SITE.md` to `README.md`.
2. Fill out TODOs in `README.md`.

### 3. Run the new site's development set up instructions

### 4. Customize your site

1.  Fill out the environment variables documented in `README-SITE.md` in [.env.local](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#loading-environment-variables).
2.  Provide [the site's constants](lib/constants.ts). Search for TODOs.
3.  Finish TODOs in [lib/translations.tsx](lib/translations.tsx).
    - **Note:** [Create new Dynamic content on Zendesk](https://signpost-global.zendesk.com/admin/workspaces/agent-workspace/dynamic_content) with your website's name in prefix
4.  Finish TODOs in [lib/social-media.tsx](lib/social-media.tsx).
    - **Note:** you might need to change Social media logo images in [public/](public/) directory
5.  Fill out custom CSS variables in [next.config.js](next.config.js).
6.  Provide the site's logo in [lib/logo.ts](lib/logo.ts).

### 5. Connect the site to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel
Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

Check out [Next.js deployment
documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## 6. Setup a domain

To set up the target domain after you have set up the site in the previous steps,
follow https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains.

## 7. Set up Google Analytics

**_Create a GA4 Property and find your Measurement ID_**

If you already have a Google Analytics Measurement ID (i.e. G-XXXXXXXXX or
UA-XXXXXXXXX), you can skip this step.

To set up Google Anaytics, you will first need to follow the [online
instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153) in order to
create a new Google Analytics 4 property and add a data stream. After this,
find your [Measurement
ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#zippy=%2Cadd-your-tag-using-google-tag-manager%2Cfind-your-g--id-for-any-platform-that-accepts-a-g--id).

**_Set up your app to collect data_**

To start data collection, you will need to add your Google Analytics ID(s) to
your local `.env.local` file and as [environment
variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) in
your vercel project settings, using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` notation. For example,
if you had a Universal Analytics ID and a Google Analytics 4 ID, you could have
the corresponding environment variables: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` and
`NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_ID`. You may have two IDs, for example, during the
[migration from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics
4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en).

Next, you will need to use the `Analytics` component from `src/analytics.tsx`
in your `pages/_app.tsx` file.
This component needs to be added as close to the top as possible (above
`<Component {...pageProps} />`). Your file should look something like the
following:

```
  ...
  import Analytics from '@ircsignpost/signpost-base/dist/src/analytics';
  ...

  function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    return (
      <>
        <Analytics googleAnalyticsIds={[process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID ?? '', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA4_ID ?? '']}/>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </>;
    );
  }

  export default MyApp;
```

Now your app should be setup to start collecting data!

**_Tracking Events_**

By default, the `Analytics` component tracks page views for you, but you may want to track other events such as page clicks, or maybe disable/enable analytics depending on a user's response to a cookie banner. In order to do this, there are a couple lightweight utility functions you can use.

**NOTE:** These functions only work if you have successfully set up and began using the `Analytics` component.

```
// Opts user out of Google Analytics tracking.
export function disableGoogleAnalytics(googleAnalyticsIds: string[]);
```

```
// Re-enables Google Analytics tracking if it was previously disabled.
export function enableGoogleAnalytics(googleAnalyticsIds: string[]);
```

```
// Tracks a click event for the given category and label.
export function trackClickEvent(eventCategory: string, eventLabel: string);
```
