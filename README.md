## Development environment setup

This section explains how to set up your development environment, so that you can build, test, and preview the site locally.

1. Install Node.js dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

2. Install Git hooks

   ```sh
   yarn prepare
   ```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

**_Note:_** To test Locale select page and Cookie banner, you need to test site in the Incognito mode or clear cookies for 'localhost' in browser settings, because selected language and cookie preferences are set in Cookies. Follow [instructions for Chrome on how to clear cookies](hhttps://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&oco=0#zippy=%2Cdelete-cookies-from-a-site).

### Environment variables

The site depends on the following environment variables that you need to provide:

- `SITE_URL` (`VERCEL_URL` is used as fallback in Vercel environments). This
  variable should represent the site's canonical URL in the environment, e.g.,
  `https://www.beporsed.org`. You most likely want to use
  `http://localhost:3000` for your [variables in
  .env.local](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#loading-environment-variables).
- `ZENDESK_URL`. The canonical Zendesk URL, e.g., `https://signpost-afghanistan.zendesk.com`.
- `ZENDESK_MAPPED_URL`. The mapped URL configured in Zendesk that Zendesk
  prepends to links, e.g., `https://www.unitedforukraine.org`.
- `ZENDESK_OAUTH_TOKEN`. [The OAuth token from Zendesk that allows
  querying their
  API](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408845965210-Using-OAuth-authentication-with-your-application).
  **_Note_** To generate it, see [Generate OAUTH token](/README.md#8-generate-zendesk-oauth-token-for-your-site) section.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`. The mapbox access token for the service map tiles.
- `PREVIEW_TOKEN`. Access token for previewing content on a live Next.js website. Use any string generator to create the preview access token for your instance, e.g. use [random.org](https://www.random.org/strings/?num=1&len=20&digits=on&upperalpha=on&loweralpha=on&unique=on&format=html&rnd=new). **_Tip_** Share the token and the [ZD preview mode instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IbtY_EvIm0c1C8yeKpEPWwPvWJyHiNehYkRpVJJ65kg/edit?usp=sharing) with content editors of the instace for them to use the preview mode manually when needed.

## Running locally

### Get the environment variables:

Some functionality, such as getting dynamic content via authenticated requests,
requires secret tokens and IDs. In order to run the server locally, we will
need to pull these environment variables into our setup. There are two ways of
doing this.

A. Sign-in to vercel to manage environment variables and copy and paste each
key-value pair into your `.env.local` file.

or

B. Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) and pull the environment
variables:

```bash
# Install the CLI
yarn global add vercel
# Setup and link your repo to the existing unitedforukraine/nextjs project
vercel link
# Pull the environment variables into your local environment
vercel env pull .env.local
```

### Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Linting & formatting

We use ESLint and [Prettier][prettier] to lint and format the directory respectively.

To check for lint and formatting errors, run

```
yarn lint
yarn prettier --check .
```

To automatically fix issues, run

```
yarn lint --fix
yarn prettier --write .
```

## Testing

This section describes practices used for testing.

### E2E testing

To run e2e tests, run

```shell
yarn e2e:headless
```

## Site's design

This section documents some of the site's design decisions.

### Sitemap & robots.txt

To improve SEO of the website, we publish robots.txt and a sitemap.

We use [next-sitemap][next-sitemap] to simplify the process of creating those
files.

[next-sitemap]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap 'next-sitemap'

### Search

We use [Algolia search engine](https://www.algolia.com/) to generate indexes for Zendesk Articles and Search queries.
See full list of Signpost indexes on Algolia Signpost Dashbaord: https://www.algolia.com/apps/BWATZIXLX6/dashboard

How to add Search to new Signpost websites:

1. Add Search index for your Signpost instance: https://www.algolia.com/getstarted/#/zendesk
   - Once added, you will see it in [Algolia Signpost dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/apps/BWATZIXLX6/dashboard)
2. Configure new search index ('Configuration' tab for your index):
   - In 'Language', populate 'Index languages' and 'Query languages' with your site's locales, e.g. see [example for U4U index](https://www.algolia.com/apps/BWATZIXLX6/explorer/configuration/zendesk_signpost-u4u_articles/language).
   - In 'Facets', add 'category.id' to 'Attributes for faceting'. It's needed to filter internal/helper articles. E.g. see [example of U4U index](https://www.algolia.com/apps/BWATZIXLX6/explorer/configuration/zendesk_signpost-u4u_articles/facets).
3. Add Queries index from your article index: https://www.algolia.com/apps/BWATZIXLX6/query-suggestions
   - Ask your Product manager (Liam) if you don't have permissions.

### Custom content elements

Zendesk articles rendered on this web site can contain [custom content elements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RyKzdU5ytXyswHtMoefjpvC7DtEMcJ1ZwJtMRsP5r4E/edit?resourcekey=0-ATE1HUHP4GrX6OPMwmJPJA#heading=h.glljwdjqb4d4). The custom elements are processed in [ArticleContent](https://github.com/unitedforukraine/signpost-base/blob/66cce03925eb3c426c3c3a2683cad7be3be7b467/src/article-content.tsx) base component.
